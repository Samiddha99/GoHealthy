                            2020, India ranked 155 out of 167 countries on Bed Availability. Due to the lack of beds in hospitals people are struggling to admit the patients.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-2">
                            India has only 69,265 Hospitals. Just 25,778 Government Hospitals and 43,487 Private Hospitals. Due to the low number of people hospitals, rural people are unable to admit patient within a short time because they have go to city to admit the patients in a hospital.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-2">
                            According to Human Development Index 2020, India has just 8.6 doctors for every 10,000 population (i.e. 1 doctor for every 1163 people). But WHO recommended a country must have at least 1 doctor for every 1000 people.
                            So that there have huge work pressure on each doctors to treat the large number of patients. This small number of doctors are not able to take care all the patients.

And in India only 60 species of snakes (i.e. 22%) are venomous out of 270 snake species, but almost 45,900 snakebite deaths occur each year in India; because shortage of anti-venom in healthcare centers increases the possibility of death of snake bite patient.

                            And India has more than 512 million eligible blood donors. 
                            This number is enough to fulfill the shortage. WHO recommends that 1 percent of a countryâ€™s population would suffice for its blood needs.
                            Annually 10 million blood are being collected. But many blood are being discarded before the expire date due to poor blood storage infrastructure. Poor blood storage infrastructure reduces the capacity of the blood banks.

                <p>If you read news each day, you find such news that the patient died due to not getting bed in hospital.
                    In the COVID-19 pandemic, this become more deadly. Shortage of bed in hospitals, is one of the main reason of highest no. of death
                    of COVID-19 patients.
                    Patient parties keep running from one hospital to another hospital to admit the patient - it consumes so
                    many valuable times, but hospitals replies we have no more beds, and so that the patient dies. If the
                    patient didnâ€™t admit to the hospital, then how he/she will receive treatment? We also see that in many
                    hospitals due to long admission process, it wastes the times - and result is death.

                    as a result of this patientâ€™s families have to suffer to find a hospital with oxygen availability to admit the patient.
                    The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the shortage of oxygen. A huge number of COVID-19 patients died just for shortage of oxygen in hospitals.

                <p>45,900 snakebite deaths occur each year in India, but in india most of the snake is non-poisonous; only 60 species of snakes are venomous out of 270 snake species.
                    But still why number of death is high? Because in most of the hospitals, specially in ruler hospitals, there have no antivenom. But most of snake bit incident happening in ruler area. So many valuable time is waste to find a hospital which hospital has Antivenom to give treatment to a sake bite patient.
                    Hence, shortage of anti-venom put thousands of lives at risk.</p>

                    time. Those who live far away from the hospital or in ruler area, for them, it is not possible to get medical support
                    quickly due to lack of rural transport infrastructure. In that case they need to contact/ consult with a
                    doctor to get medical support. But if they

                    Banks
                    have not sufficient bloods, for that reasons, patient's family need to collect blood from donors. But it is impossible
                    for
                    them to contact a blood donor. Is the patientâ€™s family go to everybody in their area and ask their blood
                    group and request them to donate blood? If patientâ€™s family do that, it will waste the time; and waste

                his/her locality he/she will get Antivenom. Just by single click when you are able to know in which
                hospital
                of your area you will get treatment of Snake Bite, then you donâ€™t need to waste your time to run from
                one
                hospital to another hospital to find a hospital which have vaccine. In this website we developed, any

            <p>In India Every day many patients died due to not get first aid treatment at right time - it already
                mentioned in the problem statement. Whatâ€™s the Solution ? Well, a solution is - to make the common
                people
                aware of First Aid. If every citizen of India know How to do First Aid, then in emergency a person can
                help
                a victim by delivering First Aid to the victim. So if the Medical Assistance Team make delay to reach to
                the
                spot, then a common person can help the victim. For that we have to make a simple, easiest and
